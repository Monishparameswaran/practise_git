Github is a central respository that is used to store all the commits ,where it plays a central server for managing all the works of various developers
## Stages 

`Working directory`  -> `staging area` -> `commits` = local respository

## commands
> git init

> git add filename or git add .   # add to the staging area

> git commit -m "mes"

> git commit -am "message"       # add and commit, cannot work if the file is new

## what is "git restore"

> git restore filename
    
     this can be used to undo the current changes and return to its previous state as how it was when staged or of in last commit.
